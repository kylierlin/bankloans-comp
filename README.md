# Bank Loans Regression Competition
STAT 301-3 Regression modeling competition

Welcome to the Matrix that is this Repository. 

To see the many models that I experimented with only to settle at a Random Forest model (which was my first attempt), click into the "model_info" folder. The Data Prep RMD and HTML files contain the many recipes and graphs I used to explore the data and conduct feature engineering on the side.

My final model, which has performed the best so far, was a random forest under model_info in an R script titled "rf_new_tune.R".
